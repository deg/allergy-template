# allergy-template
Lein template for project with latest ClojureScript + Reagent + React + Figwheel + Weasel + Heroku + Ring + Bootstrap, etc.

This is a template version of my experimental Allergy project. For now, 
for full details, see that project's [readme](https://github.com/deg/allergy).
Brief intro copied below.

_(TL;DR) This is a template for single-page ClojureScript apps, using
the Reagent interface library to Facebook React and a rich set of other
useful libraries._

_Allergy is strongly based on Chestnut, but modified to work with
Reagent rather than Om. It also lifts some key bits lifted from the
reagent sample apps._
